## 🔄 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Models Compared
1. **Waterfall Model** - Best for well-defined requirements but lacks flexibility.  
2. **Incremental Model** - Allows phased development, suitable for evolving requirements.  
3. **Spiral Model** - Ideal for risk-driven projects, offering iterative refinements.  

## ✅ Functional Requirements
- **User Management:** Registration, authentication, profile management.  
- **Order Processing:** Cart management, real-time order tracking.  
- **Payment Integration:** Support for multiple payment gateways (UPI, Cards, Wallets).  
- **Delivery Partner System:** GPS tracking, optimized route management.  
- **Customer Reviews & Support:** Feedback system, chatbot, live agent support.  

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Support for high concurrent users.  
- **Security:** Encrypted transactions and authentication.  
- **Performance:** Low-latency API responses (<1 sec).  
- **Usability:** Intuitive UI with accessibility features.
